# now-scrobbling

A WS server that broadcasts the current song I was scrobbling on [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) to all connected clients.

It was used in a very old iteration of my website, but I haven't used it in a long time. The functionality is now provided in-repo through polling a REST endpoint.
